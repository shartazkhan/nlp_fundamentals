I had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. I have a couple main points for not liking this movie.<br /><br />********** SPOILERS **********<br /><br />1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrence's character. Also, I would have NEVER picked Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I pictured Wendy much differently. I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. He's supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. Also, they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was alright, he needed more life though. He acted way to droney.<br /><br />2. The screenplay. They cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! I was extremely irritated.<br /><br />3. The Ending. The ending was changed completly, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy never got hurt...The Overlook didn't blow up. The Ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, I was apalled. Hallorann was never supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least have Jack use a roque mallet. You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.<br /><br />There are other things that I didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. The camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book, to try to be scared at all. I reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis Stanley Kubrik any more. I would never have done that, I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedge animals.<br /><br />Rating: 2/10\",\n          \"Believe it or not, this was at one time the worst movie I had ever seen. Since that time, I have seen many more movies that are worse (how is it possible??) Therefore, to be fair, I had to give this movie a 2 out of 10. But it was a tough call.\",\n          \"The biggest National Lampoon hit remains \\\"Animal House\\\", and rightly so. It was funny, raucous and good-natured.<br /><br />The exact opposite of every other National Lampoon film. Including \\\"Class Reunion\\\".<br /><br />PLEASE do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst (\\\"Flounder\\\") from \\\"Animal House\\\". Or by the fact that John Hughes wrote this jumbled mess. This reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful.<br /><br />One star, and that's being generous.

And the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say: limp affair.<br /><br />Fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though.

a melancholy deployment of light and shade; remarkable, wistful sets by alexander trauner, which are so evocative that they, as the title suggests, take on a shaping personality of their own; the quietly mournful music of maurice jaubert; a seemingly casual plot about romance, tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time, in this case louis jouvet and arletty.in fact, the film's biggest failing, and i find myself astonished (as someone who usually, didactically, minimises its importance) to admit it, is its script. it has plenty of wit and poignancy, but without the poetry and irony regular carne collaborator jacques prevert brought to their best films, it cannot avoid slipping into cliche (even if it is only cliche in hindsight).ostensibly set in the boarding house, the film sets up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tales of doomed love, and emotional, metaphysical and actual isolation the doomed love scenario is the one that works least well. annabella is very beautiful, but not very good at doing tragic, while aumont's callowness, brilliantly appropriate though it may be, by its nature obtrudes any real, felt, romance. maybe it's just me, but i find it hard to sympathise with a couple, so young, so attractive, who, after only a few months, are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other. their high-flown lines are rather embarrassing too. of course, this affair is not meant to be plausible - they are symbolic of youth, hope and possibility being crushed in france, or maybe france itself, despairing, resigned, waiting for death. for symbols to be truly powerful, they must convince on a narrative level, which, i feel, they don't quite here.what saves this plot is its connection with the story of m. edmond, a character linked to the great tradition of french gangsters. although we only learn it gradually, he is a killer in hiding, living off the prostitute played by arletty, having dobbed in his accomplices. in his previous 'role' - and the theatricality of his position is crucial - he had one set of traits; in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite. living a rather aimless life, he is profoundly shaken by the lovers' pact, and becomes fatalistic, realising the folly of trying to cheat death.in this way - the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs, and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to - edmond is like a romantic prototype of melville's clinical killers. with one exception - he gives briefly into hope, a delusion which only strenghtens - if that's not too much of an unbearable irony - his fatal resolve.all this could have been trite if it wasn't for the truly amazing performance of louis jouvet. i had studied his theatrical work at college, but this was my first taste of his screen talents, and he reveals himself to be worthy of the greats - grant, mastroianni, clift, mason, mitchum, cotten - giving a quiet nobility to a role which is more of a conception (he, needless to say, is allegorical too) than an actual person. edmond begins the film a minor supporting character, but emerges as a tragic hero of some force. like all those major actors, jouvet's brilliance lies in what he conceals.on a formal level, what amazes is carne's grasping, ten years before its flourishing, of the techniques of the great hollywood melodramas of sirk, ophuls, ray and minnelli. although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear-eyed beauty of sierck's contemporary german melodramas (check out the masterpieces zu neuen ufern and la habenera), carne's style truly fits his theme - that of entrapment, paralysis, resignation.the film's principle motif is that of water - the credits float and dissolve, the hotel stands by a waterway - but instead of renoir's open river of possibility, we have a canal, stagnant and manmade, going nowhere. the film begins as it ends, and the setting never changes, except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return. characters can only escape through death - their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy, the walls and frames that hold them captive, the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve. any hope at the end, therefore, is profoundly, if romantically, compromised.\",\n          \"overall an extremely disappointing picture. very, very slow build up to the basic storyline. the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past.

the sex is unusually graphic (and in copious supply) as is the violence (a lot of stomping to death, and a lot of blood and other organic matter splattering after bullet impact).on an intellectual level, one could make the case that the film's very essence is the relationship of sex and violence (as manifested by the only sex these women know: one is a small-time prostitute, and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films. when they, during their descent into crime and murder, have the upper hand over their sexual situations, they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand. it is important to note, however, that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex, (of which there are several)but innocent passersby, a woman at an atm, for example, as well.i myself do not really understand why the repeated \\\"porn-movie\\\" shots were all that necessary, (except to depict the physical contact as cruel, unpassionate and debased) and the unrelenting gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent spasms.it is a coarse and crude movie, but in fairness, it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances. from one point of view, the lives of the french underclasses is explored, and it's pretty grim; a travelogue for france it definitely is not- perhaps that's why the french banned it.\",\n          \"yes, it's not a great cinematic achievement, but toy soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. the young cast does a great job with both dramatic and comedic aspects of the story, and i particularly liked shawn phelan as derek/\\\"yogurt\\\". i've seen this one plenty of times over the years, and will probably see it several more. just don't think too much and you'll love it - enjoy!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sequence of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or even individual characters, depending on the granularity required for the NLP task.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Keep/Remove Tokens:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Keeping Word Tokens:** This is the most common approach. Keeping words as tokens is essential for most NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, as words carry the primary meaning.\n",
        "*   **Removing Punctuation Tokens:** Often, punctuation is removed as it might not contribute to the meaning and can increase the vocabulary size unnecessarily. However, in some cases like sentiment analysis, punctuation like \"!\" or \"?\" can be important.\n",
        "*   **Removing Stopword Tokens:** As discussed earlier, stopwords (common words like \"the\", \"a\", \"is\") are often removed when their presence doesn't add significant value to the analysis.\n",
        "*   **Keeping Subword Tokens:** For languages with complex morphology or when dealing with out-of-vocabulary words, tokenizing into subwords (like using WordPiece or BPE) can be beneficial. This is often used in transformer models.\n",
        "*   **Keeping Character Tokens:** In some specific tasks like character-level language modeling or sequence-to-sequence tasks, tokenizing into individual characters might be necessary.\n",
        "*   **Handling Special Tokens:** Depending on the model or task, special tokens (like `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, `[PAD]`) are added and should be kept for the model to function correctly."

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **When Not to Stem:** Stemming can sometimes result in stems that are not actual words or can conflate words with different meanings (e.g., \"organize\" and \"organ\" might be stemmed to \"organ\"). Avoid stemming when:\n",
        "    *   The exact meaning and form of a word are important (e.g., in text generation or machine translation).\n",
